# Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Portuguese Word Embeddings

This work analyse the gender bias of a Portuguese pre-trained Language Model and performs an investigation of different methods for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes. In our experiemnts, we've found few examples of gender  bias  and stereotypes and demonstrated that is possible to reduce gender bias in Portuguese embeddings while preserving its properties such as analogy tasks.
